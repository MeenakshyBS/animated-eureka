Decentralized Voting System
### Introduction:  
- To create a secure electronic voting system that provides fairness, confidentiality, transparency and flexibility not found in traditional voting methods. In the course of this work, blockchain will be used to implement and evaluate a decentralized electronic voting system. We propose a new blockchain-based electronic voting system that removes some of the limitations of the existing system, and evaluate the popular blockchain frameworks for building a blockchain-based voting system. We aim to implement blockchain-based applications that enhance security and reduce the cost of running national elections. Everyone's welcome to contribute. 
- A client side application that will connect with the smart contract. This application have the candidate id, name and votes. we are able to cast a code for specific candidate via using account that we have linked to the blockchain using Metamask. 
### DIRECTORY STRUCTURE 
- build/contracts/ contains Election and Migration json files contracts/ contains Election.sol and Migration.sol contracts migrations/ contains migration files wich is similar other web development frameworks that require migrations to change the state of a database. src/ contains all client side folder and files like JS, CSS, Font, Images, HTML . test/ contains tests files for our smart contracts. truffle-config.js / contains main configuration file for our Truffle project DEPENDENCIES :- Node Package Manager(NPM):- We required this dependency. You can download Node.js or by using following command you can install npm.
